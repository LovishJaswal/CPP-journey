# C++ Basics Repository

Welcome to my C++ practice repository. This is where I'm writing and organizing simple C++ programs as I revise all the basics step by step. Everything is written and tested by me.

---

## What's Inside

This repo contains beginner-friendly code examples categorized by topics like syntax, input/output, conditionals, loops, arrays, and operators.

- hello_world.cpp – Basic syntax and structure of a C++ program
- input_output.cpp – Demonstrates user input and output using cin and cout
- if_else.cpp – Checks voting eligibility using if-else
- nested_if.cpp – Checks both voting and election eligibility using nested if
- grade_checker.cpp – Assigns grade based on marks using if-else-if ladder
- switch_statement.cpp – Uses a switch statement to print the day of the week
- comparison_operators.cpp – Uses ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= to compare two integers
- logical_operators.cpp – Demonstrates logical AND, OR, and NOT
- arithmetic_operators.cpp – Shows +, -, *, /, and % with two integers
- assignment_operators.cpp – Demonstrates assignment operations like +=, -=, &= etc.
- for_loop.cpp – Prints numbers from 1 to n using a for loop
- while_loop.cpp – Uses while loop to print numbers from 1 to n
- do_while_loop.cpp – Uses do-while to count down from n to 1
- arrays.cpp – Initializes and prints elements from a character array

## Folder Plan

Right now, everything is inside the `Basics` folder. Later, I plan to organize topics into subfolders like:

- loops/
- conditional_statements/
- operators/
- arrays/
- functions/
- classes/

## Note

This is a personal learning repo — everything is written from scratch. No copy-pasting from online sources or tutorials. I'm updating it as I learn, one step at a time.

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on conditionals and loops. Next up: functions and arrays in more detail.
