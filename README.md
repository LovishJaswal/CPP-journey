# C++ Basics Repository

Welcome to my C++ practice repository!  
This is where I’m writing and organizing beginner-friendly C++ programs as I revise all the core concepts step by step — from syntax to loops, and eventually to mini-projects. Everything is written and tested by me.

## Project Structure

- Basics/
- Conditional_statements/
- Loops/
- Operators/
- Structures/
- README.md

Each folder contains relevant `.cpp` files with clean code and comments.

## Topics Covered

### Basics
- hello_world.cpp – Syntax and basic output
- input_output.cpp – User input/output with cin and cout
- Syntax.cpp – General C++ structure overview

### Loops
- For_loop.cpp – Prints numbers from 1 to n
- While_loop.cpp – Prints numbers using while loop
- Do_While.cpp – Countdown using do-while
- Break_Continue.cpp – Use of break and continue inside loops

### Conditional Statements
- If_else.cpp – Voting eligibility check
- Nested_if.cpp – Voting and election eligibility
- Grade_checker.cpp – Grading system using if-else-if
- Switch_case.cpp – Day of the week using switch

### Operators
- Arithmetic_operators.cpp – +, -, *, /, %
- Assignment_operators.cpp – =, +=, -=, etc.
- Comparison_operators.cpp – ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Logical_operators.cpp – &&, ||, !

### Structures
- Structures.cpp – Defines a struct for student data

## How to Run

To compile and run any `.cpp` file:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
