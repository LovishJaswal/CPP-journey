# 🚀 CPP-Journey

This is my C++ learning journey — from basics to mini projects.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `basics/` → Contains basic C++ programs like input/output, if-else, etc.
- `.vscode/` → VS Code settings
- `.gitignore` → Hides unnecessary files like .exe from GitHub

## 🛠 How to Run

To compile any file, use:

g++ filename.cpp -o run.exe  
./run.exe

Or just press `Ctrl + Shift + B` in VS Code.
